# Security requirement: Avoid mutable identifiers in policies
{: .no_toc }

Mutable identifiers can't be used in policy statements. An example of a mutable identifier is a user name or group name in a workforce directory, where the value of the name can change. Usage of such a name in a policy may appear as follows:

```cedar
permit (
    principal in Group::"TeamExample",
    action in ...,
    resource in ...
);
```

If the group name was changed, it would no longer match this policy. If the group was deleted and the name was reused for a different group, the new group members would receive the permissions of any policies that hadnâ€™t been removed when the original group was deleted.

For these reasons, policies must refer to only unique, normalized, immutable, and non-recyclable identifiers. Use universally unique identifiers (UUIDs) or similar formats that meet the same criteria, such as sequence numbers or uniform resource names (URNs).

```cedar
permit (
    principal in Group::"fcaf664d4f89fec0cda8", // "TeamExample"
    action in ...,
    resource in ...
);
```
